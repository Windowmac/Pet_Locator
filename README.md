GETTING STARTED:

-On page load you will be greeted by one of our adoptable pets.

-From here, simply enter the zip code of the location you would like to search for an adoptable doggo.

-Next, enter your preferred dog breed.

-After that, select your Personal Housing Requirements. This will help narrow down the search results by selecting if the dog needs to be good with other dogs, cats, children, etc.
