DESCRIPTION:
This application is designed to aid your search in your quest to adopt a dog.
Our goal is to make the adoption of a dog the first option for new dog owners weather it's their first or 100th.
With use of the [Pet Finder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/#animal), plus the other features of the application, this applicaiton will provide you with all of the information that you would need to adopt a dog.

See wesite at https://windowmac.github.io/Pet_Locator/

GETTING STARTED:
On page load you will be greeted by one of our adoptable pets.
From here simply enter the zip code of the location you would like to search for an adoptable doggo.
Next, enter your preferred dog breed.
After that, select your Personal Housing Requirements. This will help narrow down the search results by selecting if the dog needs to be good with other dogs, cats, children, etc.
