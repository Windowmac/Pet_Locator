        <h5>Adoption Guide</h5>
        <p>Congratulations! You’re about to become a new dog parent. Few things are as rewarding as adopting and caring
            for
            a pooch. Bringing home a new dog is a big step. Here are some tips to adopting the perfect dog.</p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Be realistic about your lifestyle and energy level. If you’re a couch potato, don’t adopt a dog who
            needs lots
            of exercise. Adopt a dog with the same or lower energy level as you. And if you work long hours or travel
            frequently, don’t adopt a puppy. They need lots of training and attention. Adopt a laid-back guy instead.
        </p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Who else lives in your home? Do you have young children or other pets? It’s important to adopt a
            dog that will
            fit in safely and happily with all the members of your household. If you’re new to dog parenthood, have
            small
            children at home, and a demanding job, getting a high-maintenance dog might not be a good idea. You would
            probably do better with a chill, older dog who doesn’t need to be trained.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.</b>Think critically about your future. Do you want kids? Plan on getting married? Every year, thousands
            of dogs are left at shelters because “family circumstances” changed. For a small number of people, there is
            a real, unexpected change. But most people simply decided to have a baby or are getting married. These are
            extremely common events in a person’s life. Plan ahead.</p>
        <p><b>4.</b>Do you have a high-tolerance for fur and slobber? If you keep an extremely clean home, think hard
            before adopting a dog who sheds a lot or slobbers everywhere. Some people don’t mind the extra time it takes
            to brush their dog every day to reduce shedding or wipe slobber from walls.</p>

        <h5>Preparing Your Home</h5>
        <p>Prepare the items your dog will need in advance: You'll need a flat-buckle or martingale collar and
            identification tag, a harness and a 6-foot nylon leash, food and water bowls, a bed—and toys! We
            recommend toys that are unlikely to be swallowed, such as Nylabones (not to be confused with rawhide,
            which we do not recommend) until you have a sense of whether your dog will shred or ingest toys.</p>
        <p>You might also consider an appropriately-sized crate or enclosed pet playpen that's large enough for your
            dog to stand up and turn around in for use as a safe, quiet "den."</p>
        <p>If you know what kind of food your dog has been eating, plan to buy a small bag to keep their diet
            consistent. You can always change food down the road, but you’ll want to gradually mix the current food
            with the new food to avoiding upsetting their stomach.</p>

            Safest</a>
        <h5>Plan The Arrival</h5>
        <P>Arrange the arrival of your new dog for a weekend or when you can be home for a few days. Get to know each
            other and spend some quality time together. For the first few weeks, you'll want to make sure you establish
            a routine with your dog so they know what to expect and grow to trust you, but don’t rush your new dog into
            unfamiliar situations. It can be tempting to take them to a busy park or dog park or to bring them to the
            pet supply store to pick out toys, but most dogs will be overwhelmed simply by the transition to your home
            so keep things as quiet and consistent as possible for the first week or more. Feed, walk and come and go
            from work around the same times each day.</P>
        <p>When you do leave home, consider leaving your dog with an enrichment item, such as a stuffed treat toy or
            puzzle food bowl. This provides mental and physical distraction and can prevent issues like separation
            anxiety.</p>
        <h5>Prepare for House-Training</h5>
        <p>Assume your new dog is not house-trained and work from there. Be consistent and maintain a routine. Bear in
            mind that many house-trained dogs might initially eliminate in your home while they get used to a new
            environment and routine; you can prevent this by taking them out every few hours so their bladder is nice
            and empty.</p>
